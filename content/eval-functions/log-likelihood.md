### summary
- aka negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss
- it is the log of the [[likelihood]] function

- Why use log likelihood instead of the pure likelihood function?
	- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/892832/why-we-consider-log-likelihood-instead-of-likelihood-in-gaussian-distribution
	- since ln(a\*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), many equations simplify significantly
	- so we use the log likelihood over the likelihood
