	- how it works:
		- the idea is that if you know how. a table's features are distributed, then if you see missing data, you can infer the missing column
		- this doesn't only apply to the target column, but to other input columns as well
	- This model is a seq-to-seq model. The idea is to impute the missing data.
		- the encoder will create a representation of the data
		- the decoder will read this representation and guess the missing data
	- how the feature transformer owrks
