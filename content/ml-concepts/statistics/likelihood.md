- This is NOT bayes rule. It's completely different
	- **probability is:** given a distribution, what is the the probability I'll see this data?
	- **likelihood is:** given data that I know, what is the likelihood it came from this distribution?
- note that likelihood and probability have different conditionals (priors)
	- in probability, the distribution is fixed
	- in likelihood, the distribution is fixed
