- Each sample can belong to one or multiple classes at the same time.
	- don't confuse with [[multi-class classification]].
- Since each x can belong to more than one correct label, you want to apply a [[sigmoid]] to each individual class, rather than a [[Softmax]] over all classes
	- sigmoid means: each label has a 0-1 probability of being chosen, but softmax will only allow one label to have a high probability of being chosen
