- One assumption is: "The public leaderboard should be similar to the private leaderboard"
	- If the public leaderboard is very different from your train data, you have to make your train dataset look like the predicted test data
		- see [[LANL Earthquake Prediction]] to understand how to do this
- How to probe?

	- You basically send a bunch of submissions where yhat is the same value for all rows:
		- "if I submit yhat=1, what is my score?"
		- "if I submit yhat=2, what is my score?"
		- "if I submit yhat=3, what is my score?"
	- this can tell you how the public LB is distributed.
	- you do the same with your train dataset to see if the score is similar
- **TLDR: Try your best to figure out what is the distribution of the test data. Make sure your training data has a distribution that matches the test data.**
